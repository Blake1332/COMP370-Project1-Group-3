# COMP370-Project1-Group-3

##TODO
- write linux bash script to launch (run.sh)
- implement client
- persistence (maybe)
- test cases (junit would be nice!)
- dynamic adding and removeing of members (currently hard coded into raftserver.java)
- simulation of failures for both network and node crashes to see if the cluster remains
